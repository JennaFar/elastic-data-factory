# Each line represents a rule, followed by a list of members.
# These members are the default owners for all files that match the specified pattern.
# The pattern generally follows the same syntax used for .gitignore files.
# The last matching rule always wins; those that appear lower in the file take precedence over rules that appear higher up.
# Specify owners by their username, email, or role assignment in the project.

# Examples:

# Member with username "JFarhan" and member with email "jennafarhan@rocketcentral.com"
# own any Python file in the repository
*.py JFarhan jennafarhan@rocketcentral.com

# Jenna handles Gradle files
*.html JFarhan


# All members who are assigned the Project Collaborator role own any file under docs/ directory
# anywhere in the repository, but not further nested files
docs/* "Project Collaborator"

# This file itself is owned by members who are assigned the Project Admin role in this project.
